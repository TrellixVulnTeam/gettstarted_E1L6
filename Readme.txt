The code for this project is mainly from https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/ except for few customisations. 
This is a website I developed while learning Django. 

To create a portfolio website, you may download the files, copy in a test folder and run using the following commands on your machine:

python manage.py makemigrations projects 
python manage.py migrate projects 
python manage.py makemigrations blog 
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

Visit localhost:8000/projects/ in the browser to view the home page.
