This is a website I developed while learning Django from https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/. 

It is a portfolio website that you may download and run on your machine.

Create a portfolio folder and run the following in your command line.

python manage.py makemigrations projects 
python manage.py migrate projects 
python manage.py makemigrations blog 
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

Visit localhost:8000/projects/ in the browser to view the home page.
